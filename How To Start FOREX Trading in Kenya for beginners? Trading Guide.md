## Introduction
Forex (foreign exchange) trading involves buying and selling currency pairs—such as USD/KES or EUR/USD—to profit from exchange rate fluctuations. In Kenya, improved internet access, mobile-money options, and global broker availability have made Forex trading popular among beginners. This guide will walk you through every step to start trading Forex safely and effectively from Kenya.

## Is Forex Trading Legal in Kenya?
Forex trading through Contracts for Difference (CFDs) or spot FX is legal in Kenya, but brokers must be licensed by recognized authorities—either the **Capital Markets Authority (CMA)** for local firms or reputable international regulators (FCA, ASIC, CySEC) for offshore brokers. Always verify your broker’s regulatory status on their website.

## Understanding the Forex Market
- **Currency Pairs**: Comprised of a base and quote currency (e.g., USD/KES).  
- **Bid & Ask**: Bid = price you sell; Ask = price you buy.  
- **Spread**: The difference between ask and bid, representing your trading cost.  
- **Leverage**: Allows you to control larger positions with a small margin (offshore brokers often offer up to 1:500, though beginners should use ≤1:50).  
- **Lot Sizes**: Standard (100,000 units), mini (10,000), micro (1,000).
