## Why Trade Forex in Zimbabwe?

- **Hedge local currency risk**: ZWL volatility can erode savings—forex trading offers diversification.  
- **Access global markets**: Trade majors (USD/ZWL, EUR/USD) 24/5 from Harare or Bulawayo.  
- **Low entry barrier**: Start with as little as $10 or equivalent in ZWL.  
- **Leverage**: Amplify small capital (use responsibly).
