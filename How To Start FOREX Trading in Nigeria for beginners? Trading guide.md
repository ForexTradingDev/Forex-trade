## Is Forex Trading Legal in Nigeria?
Forex trading is **legal** in Nigeria, but the retail spot forex market is **unregulated** locally. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversee financial markets, yet as of 2018 they noted that online retail forex trading falls outside their jurisdiction and is ‚Äúsubject to abuse‚Äù :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Despite this, Nigerians commonly trade with offshore brokers regulated by top-tier authorities (FCA, CySEC, ASIC), and must report any gains for taxation purposes :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
