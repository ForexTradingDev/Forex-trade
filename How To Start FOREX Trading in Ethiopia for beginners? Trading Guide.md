## Introduction
Forex (foreign exchange) trading is the act of speculating on currency pair price movements—such as USD/ETB or EUR/USD—to profit from exchange rate fluctuations. Ethiopia’s growing internet penetration and rising mobile-money adoption make Forex accessible to beginners. This guide will take you step-by-step from understanding the basics to placing your first live trade.

## Is Forex Trading Legal in Ethiopia?
Forex trading through Contracts for Difference (CFDs) or spot FX is **not currently regulated** by the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). Most Ethiopian traders use **offshore brokers** licensed by top-tier regulators (FCA, ASIC, CySEC). Always ensure your chosen broker holds a reputable license and practices client-fund segregation.

## Understanding the Forex Market
- **Currency Pairs**: Consist of a base and a quote currency (e.g., USD/ETB).  
- **Bid & Ask**: Bid = price you sell; Ask = price you buy.  
- **Spread**: The difference between Ask and Bid; your primary trading cost.  
- **Leverage**: Borrowed funds that let you control larger positions (offshore brokers may offer up to 1:500—but beginners should use ≤1:50).  
- **Lot Sizes**:  
  - **Standard**: 100,000 units  
  - **Mini**: 10,000 units  
  - **Micro**: 1,000 units
