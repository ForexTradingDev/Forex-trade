## Introduction
Forex (foreign exchange) trading lets you speculate on currency pair price movements—such as USD/PKR, EUR/PKR, GBP/USD—seeking profit from exchange rate fluctuations. With increasing internet penetration and mobile adoption in Pakistan, traders can access global markets from home. This guide takes you through everything a beginner needs to start trading Forex confidently and responsibly.

## Is Forex Trading Legal in Pakistan?
Forex trading with **over-the-counter (OTC)** brokers is **not** directly regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) or SECP. However, Pakistanis commonly trade through offshore brokers regulated by recognized authorities (FCA, CySEC, ASIC). Always choose a reputable, well‑regulated broker to protect your funds and ensure fair trading conditions.

## Understanding the Forex Market
- **Currency Pairs**: Two currencies quoted against each other (e.g., USD/PKR).  
- **Bid & Ask**: Bid = price you sell; Ask = price you buy.  
- **Spread**: Ask minus Bid; your primary cost per trade.  
- **Leverage**: Borrowed funds to control larger positions (offshore brokers may offer up to 1:500; use with caution).  
- **Lot Sizes**: Standard (100,000 units), mini (10,000), micro (1,000).
